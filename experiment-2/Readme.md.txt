In this experiment-
we learned how routing works in a Single Page Application using React. We understood that instead of loading a new page every time, the application changes content on the same page, which makes the website faster and smoother to use.

We learned how to navigate between different pages like Home, Text Field, and Select by using the react-router-dom library. Components such as Browser Router, Routes, Route, and Link helped us move from one page to another without refreshing the browser.

This experiment also helped us understand how to divide our application into different components and connect them using routes. It made our code more organized and easier to manage.

Overall, this experiment helped us understand how modern websites work, how navigation happens smoothly in React applications, and how routing improves the user experience.
