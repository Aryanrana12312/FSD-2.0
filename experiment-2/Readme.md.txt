We learned how to design modern and responsive user interfaces using ready-made components provided by UI component libraries.

We understood how to use pre-built components such as buttons, text fields, and dropdowns to build user interfaces quickly and efficiently.

We learned how component libraries help maintain a consistent look and feel across the entire application.

This experiment helped us understand how reusable components reduce development time and simplify code maintenance.

We also gained practical experience in integrating component libraries into a React project and customizing them according to design requirements.
